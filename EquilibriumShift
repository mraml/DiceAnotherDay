# Equilibrium Shift: Card Core Edition - A Solo/Co-op Card Game

**Game Overview:**

The goal is to play cards from your hand to "offset" an initial Opposing Hand. The challenge lies in meeting criteria determined by a d20 roll and a coin flip, creating pressure to find the right card combinations.

**Components:**

* 1 standard deck of 54 cards (including Jokers)
* 1 twenty-sided die (1d20)
* 1 coin

**Setup:**

1.  **Opposing Hand:** Shuffle the deck and draw 3 cards face-up. This is the Opposing Hand.
2.  **Player Hand:** Deal yourself (or each player in co-op) 5 cards face-down.

**Gameplay:**

Each round unfolds as follows:

1.  **Determine the Offset Criteria:**
    * Roll the 1d20. The result is the **Target Value**.
    * Flip the coin.
        * **Heads:** Offset criteria focus on **High Card Rank**.
        * **Tails:** Offset criteria focus on **Matching Suit**.

2.  **Analyze the Opposing Hand:** Examine the 3 cards in the Opposing Hand.

3.  **Plan Your Offset:** Based on the Target Value and the Coin flip, decide which card(s) from your hand you want to play to offset the Opposing Hand. You can play one or more cards in a single turn.

4.  **Attempt the Offset:** Reveal the card(s) you wish to play.

5.  **Determine Success:**

    * **High Card Rank Focus (Coin is Heads):** The **highest rank** of the card(s) you played must be **equal to or greater than** the Target Value.
        * Aces = 1
        * Number cards = Face value
        * Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13
        * Jokers = Any rank from 1 to 13 (declared before revealing).

    * **Matching Suit Focus (Coin is Tails):** You must play a card (or cards) whose suit(s) **match at least one** of the suits present in the Opposing Hand.
        * Jokers = Any suit (declared before revealing).

    * **Target Pressure:** If the **lowest rank** of the cards in the *Opposing Hand* is **less than or equal to** half the Target Value (rounded down), you face additional pressure (see "Pressure Effects").
        * Aces = 1, Number cards = Face value, Face = 11-13, Jokers = 0 (for this calculation).

    * **Exact Match Bonus:** If, under **High Card Rank Focus**, the highest rank of the card you played is **exactly equal** to the Target Value, you gain a **Match Bonus** (see "Bonuses").

6.  **Resolution:**
    * **Successful Offset:** Discard the card(s) you played and the corresponding card(s) from the Opposing Hand that you offset. If you offset all three Opposing Hand cards in a single turn, proceed to the "End of Round".
    * **Failed Offset:** The card(s) you played are discarded, and the Opposing Hand remains the same.

7.  **Draw New Cards:** At the end of your turn, draw cards from the deck until you have 5 cards in your hand again. If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile to form a new draw pile.

**End of Round:**

A round concludes when all three cards in the Opposing Hand have been successfully offset.

**Continuing the Game (Solo or Co-op):**

1.  **New Opposing Hand:** Draw 3 new cards face-up to form a new Opposing Hand.
2.  **Continue Playing:** Begin the next round.

**Game End Condition:**

The game ends when either:

* **Success:** You (or the co-op team) successfully offset a predetermined number of Opposing Hands (e.g., 5, 10).
* **Failure:** You are unable to offset any cards in the Opposing Hand for three consecutive rounds.

**Pressure Effects (Triggered by the Target Pressure):**

When the Target Pressure is triggered, one of the following happens (determined randomly, e.g., by card suit: Spades=1, Hearts=2, Diamonds=3, Clubs=4, Jokers=5 or 6):

1.  **Hand Reduction:** Discard one random card from your hand.
2.  **Opposing Advantage:** The Target Value for the next round is increased by 3.
3.  **Limited Information:** You cannot use the rank or suit information of one card in your hand for the current turn.
4.  **Single Play:** You can only play a maximum of one card this turn.
5.  **Discard Weakest:** Discard the card in your hand with the lowest rank (Ace is lowest, then 2, etc. Jokers are considered the lowest).
6.  **No Immediate Effect:** The pressure doesn't affect this turn, but the Target Value for the *next* round is increased by 1.

**Bonuses (Triggered by Exact Match):**

When the highest rank of the card you played exactly matches the Target Value (under High Card Rank Focus), choose one of the following bonuses:

1.  **Bonus Draw:** Draw one additional card.
2.  **Opposing Swap:** Replace one card of your choice in the Opposing Hand with the top card of the draw pile.
3.  **Peek Ahead:** Look at the top two cards of the draw pile.

**Solo Play Variations:**

* **High Score:** Track the number of Opposing Hands you successfully offset before failing.
* **Limited Turns:** Try to offset a set number of Opposing Hands within a limited number of rounds.

**Co-op Play Variations:**

* **Shared Hand:** Players share a single hand of cards.
* **Individual Hands:** Players have their own hands and must coordinate which cards to play.
* **Combined Offset:** Players can combine cards from their individual hands to offset the Opposing Hand.
