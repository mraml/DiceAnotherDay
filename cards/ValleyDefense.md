## HOW TO PLAY

### TURN ORDER
1. **Your Turn** - Take 3 actions
2. **Left Army** - Flip 1 card, advance all
3. **Right Army** - Flip 1 card, advance all

### YOUR ACTIONS (Pick 3)

**MOVE** - Switch to Left/Center/Right Wall
- Wall gets +3 HP while you're there
- **DIE if:** Damage on your wall > (Wall HP + 3)

**ATTACK-RANGE (♠ Spades)** - Kill enemy ≤ value in Middle/Back rows → top of Chest

**ATTACK-MELEE (♦ Diamonds)** - Kill enemy ≤ value in Front/Wall → top of Chest

**REINFORCE (♥ Hearts)** - Stand up broken wall with HP = card value

**DELAY (♣ Clubs)** - Move enemy ≤ value to back of their army

**DRAW** - Draw 2 cards
- **Joker drawn:** 7 damage to your current wall, discard Joker

**LOOT** - Use top Chest card immediately for its suit ability, then discard

### ARMY TURNS

**1. FLIP:** Reveal 1 face-down Back Row card
- **Face card (J/Q/K/A):** Draw 1 card from deck, add face-down behind army
- **Joker:** Destroys most recent naturally-flipped enemy, becomes 7 HP enemy

**2. ADVANCE:** Cards move forward if space is empty
- Front Row → Wall (adds damage = card value)
- Middle → Front
- Back → Middle

**JOKER AT WALL:** Deals 4 damage (half of 7, rounded up)

---

## WINNING & LOSING

**WIN:** Defeat all enemies, at least 1 wall standing

**LOSE:**
- Damage on your wall > Wall HP + 3
- All walls broken, can't reinforce
- Deck empty, can't act

## QUICK REFERENCE

**Card Values:** 2-10 = face value, J=11, Q=12, K=13, A=14, Joker=7

**Suits:**
- ♠ = Range attack (Middle/Back)
- ♦ = Melee attack (Front/Wall)
- ♥ = Rebuild wall
- ♣ = Push enemy back

**Wall broken?** Damage ≥ Wall HP → turn sideways
