# Die for the Colony: A Strategic Dice Game

## Components
- 1 player controls the Ant Colony (uses d20s)
- 1 player controls the Grasshopper Swarm (uses d20s)
- 4 six-sided dice (d6) placed at the center of the playing area, all initially showing "3"

## Objective
- **Ant Colony**: Build your army and turn all center dice to "6"
- **Grasshopper Swarm**: Suppress the ant colony and turn all center dice to "1"

## Setup
1. Place the 4d6 in the center of the play area, all showing "3"
2. Each player starts with 2d20 representing their initial forces
3. The Ant Colony player always goes first
4. Flip a coin to determine who plays as Ants first
5. Players swap teams (Ants/Grasshoppers) after each game

## Turn Structure
On your turn, perform these phases in order:
1. **Recruitment Phase**: Roll 1d20 to add to your forces (see Recruitment rules)
2. **Action Phase**: Assign each of your d20s to perform one action
3. **End Phase**: Check for victory conditions

## Recruitment Phase
- Roll 1d20
- If the result is 15-20: Add a new d20 to your forces
- If the result is 1-5: Your opponent adds a new d20 to their forces
- If the result is 6-14: No new forces are added

## Action Phase
Assign each of your d20s to one of these actions:

### 1. ATTACK
- Target one of the center d6
- Roll your d20
- If you roll 11 or higher:
  - **Ants**: Increase the target d6 by 1 (max 6)
  - **Grasshoppers**: Decrease the target d6 by 1 (min 1)
- Your opponent may block with one of their unassigned d20s

### 2. DEFEND
- When your opponent launches a Direct Assault, you may block with an unassigned d20
- Both players roll their d20s
- If blocker's roll equals or exceeds attacker's roll, the assault fails
- The blocking d20 is then considered used

### 3. MOBILIZE
- Roll your d20 and announce the result
- If you roll 14 or higher:
  - **Ants**: Choose two adjacent center dice. Decrease one by 1 and increase the other by 2 (within limits of 1-6)
  - **Grasshoppers**: Choose two adjacent center dice. Increase one by 1 and decrease the other by 2 (within limits of 1-6)
- Your opponent may use an unassigned d20 to DISRUPT the mobilization:
  - If the defending player rolls higher than the attacker's initial roll, they block 1 point of the transfer
  - This means the receiving die only changes by 1 instead of 2
  - The disrupting d20 is then considered used

### 4. SABOTAGE
- Target one of your opponent's unused d20s
- Roll your d20
- If you roll 17 or higher, the targeted d20 cannot be used this turn
- Your opponent may attempt to evade by rolling one of their unassigned d20s
- If they roll 15 or higher, they successfully evade

### 5. FORTIFY
- Choose one center d6
- Roll your d20
- If you roll 16 or higher:
  - Place a marker on that d6 (use a coin or token)
  - While marked, opponents need to roll 13+ (instead of 11+) for Direct Assaults against this d6
  - Remove all markers at the end of your next turn
- This action cannot be blocked

## Strategy Tips
- **Ants**: Focus on protecting high-value d6s (showing 5s) while steadily advancing others
- **Grasshoppers**: Target d6s showing high numbers first to slow the ants' progress
- Territory Control creates temporary safe zones for your most critical objectives
- Swarm Tactics offer efficient but less reliable progress

## Victory Conditions
- **Ant Colony** wins if all four center d6s show "6"
- **Grasshopper Swarm** wins if all four center d6s show "1"
- If 15 complete rounds pass without a winner, the player who has moved more dice toward their goal wins

## Game Balance Features
- The first-player advantage for Ants is balanced by team-swapping between games
- Each action has distinct strategic purposes and risk/reward profiles
- Multiple defensive options allow for tactical counterplay

Enjoy your battle for the colony!
