# Superior Gale
## A Cooperative Great Lakes Shipwreck Survival Game for Two Players

### Components Needed
- 1 twenty-sided die (d20)
- 1 ten-sided die (d10)
- 4 six-sided dice (d6)
- 1 coin
- Pen and paper (optional, for tracking)

### Theme
You are the captain and first mate of an ore freighter caught in a violent November storm on Lake Superior. Your vessel has struck a hidden shoal and is taking on water rapidly. Your mission is to evacuate your crew members into lifeboats before the mighty gale claims your ship entirely.

---

## Setup

1. Place the **d20 on "20"** - Ship's structural integrity
2. Place all four **d6 on "1"** - Four lifeboats, each with 1 crew already aboard
3. Place the **d10 on "0"** - Crew swept overboard
4. Decide who goes first

---

## Objective

Fill all four lifeboats to capacity (all d6 at "6") before the ship breaks apart (d20 reaches "0").

---

## Turn Sequence

Players alternate turns. On your turn:

### 1. Ship Condition Check
**Flip a coin:**
- **Heads:** Ship condition stays the same
- **Tails:** Ship condition worsens by 1 (decrease d20 by 1)

### 2. Choose One Action (Flip a Coin)

**Load a Lifeboat:**
- **Heads:** Load 2 crew into any lifeboat(s) (increase d6 by 2 total, split as you choose)
- **Tails:** Load 1 crew into any lifeboat (increase d6 by 1)
- Cannot exceed d6 = 6 per lifeboat

**Reinforce Hull:**
- **Heads:** Improve ship condition by 2 (increase d20 by 2, max 20)
- **Tails:** Improve ship condition by 1 (increase d20 by 1, max 20)

**Rescue Overboard Crew:**
- **Heads:** Rescue 2 crew from overboard (decrease d10 by 2, minimum 0)
- **Tails:** Rescue 1 crew from overboard (decrease d10 by 1, minimum 0)
- Rescued crew are ready to load into lifeboats on future turns

### 3. Storm Phase

Check current ship condition (d20) and resolve:

**15-20 (Light Storm):**
- No effect

**10-14 (Moderate Storm):** Roll 1d20
- **1-8:** One random lifeboat damaged (decrease one d6 by 1, minimum 1; crew swept overboard)
- **9-20:** No additional damage

**5-9 (Severe Storm):** Roll 1d20
- **1-10:** One crew swept overboard (increase d10 by 1)
- **11-17:** One random lifeboat severely damaged (decrease one d6 by 2, minimum 1; crew swept overboard)
- **18-20:** No additional damage

**1-4 (Hurricane Force):** Roll 1d20
- **1-12:** Two crew swept overboard (increase d10 by 2)
- **13-17:** All lifeboats damaged (decrease all d6 by 1, minimum 1; crew swept overboard)
- **18-20:** Ship condition decreases by 1 additional point

**Note:** When crew are swept overboard due to lifeboat damage, increase d10 by the number of crew lost.

---

## Game End

### Victory
All four lifeboats reach capacity (all d6 at "6") before the ship sinks. You've saved the crew!

### Defeat
- **Ship Sinks:** d20 reaches "0" before all lifeboats are full
- **Lost at Sea:** d10 reaches "10" (too many crew swept overboard)

---

## Strategy Tips

- **Balance your actions:** Loading crew wins the game, but you need to manage ship integrity and overboard crew
- **Watch the ship condition:** When d20 drops below 15, storms become dangerous
- **Don't ignore overboard crew:** If d10 reaches 10, you lose immediately
- **Communicate:** Discuss strategy with your partner - this is a team effort
- **Hurricane force is deadly:** When ship reaches 1-4, every turn is critical

---

## Quick Reference

**Ship Condition Check:** Flip coin (Tails = -1 to d20)

**Actions (Flip coin):**
- Load: Heads = 2 crew, Tails = 1 crew
- Reinforce: Heads = +2 ship, Tails = +1 ship  
- Rescue: Heads = 2 saved, Tails = 1 saved

**Storm Severity:**
- 15-20: Safe
- 10-14: Moderate danger
- 5-9: Severe danger
- 1-4: Hurricane force

**Win:** All d6 at 6  
**Lose:** d20 at 0 OR d10 at 10
