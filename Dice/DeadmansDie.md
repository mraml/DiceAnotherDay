- Players MUST roll within 3 seconds
- Dice not rolled in time count as miss (0 damage)
- Each player:
  - **Deals damage** = number shown on their Gun die
  - **Loses 1 ammo** (decrease Ammo die by 1)
  - **Takes damage** = opponent's Gun die result (decrease Health die)

#### 3. Ammo Check
- If your **Ammo reaches 0**, you cannot shoot anymore
- You must forfeit the duel (opponent wins) OR negotiate surrender

#### 4. Resolution
- First player to reduce opponent's **Health to 0** wins the duel
- Check for bonus gold (see Optional Reward Rules)
- Winner collects the **gold pot** from Reward Phase
- Winner's Health and Ammo **carry over** to next duel (unless healed/restocked at Store)

## Strategy Tips

1. **Manage ammo carefully** - Running out means instant loss
2. **Health carries over** - Buy health between duels when wounded
3. **Save gold for endgame** - Advanced items (20g) give significant advantages in finals
4. **Bonus gold is rare** - Don't count on it, but celebrate when it happens
5. **Speed doesn't matter much** - Unlike real gunfights, damage is what counts

Remember, partner: It ain't just about luck—it's about knowing when to spend your gold wisely!
