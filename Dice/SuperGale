# Superior Gale
## A Cooperative Great Lakes Shipwreck Survival Game for Two Players

### Components Needed
- 1 twenty-sided die (d20)
- 1 ten-sided die (d10)
- 4 six-sided dice (d6)
- Pen and paper to track crew

### Theme
You are the captain and first mate of an ore freighter caught 
in a violent November storm on Lake Superior. Your vessel has 
struck a hidden shoal and is taking on water rapidly. Your 
mission is to evacuate your remaining crew members into lifeboats before the mighty gale claims your ship entirely.

### Setup
1. Place the d20 on "20" - this represents the ship's structural integrity before breaking apart
2. Place all four d6 on "1" - these represent the four lifeboats, each with 1 crew member already aboard (these are your rescue coordinators)
3. Place the d10 on "1" - this represents overboard crew.
4. Each player starts with 10 crew members (including the 2 in lifeboats assigned to each player)
   - Player 1: 8 crew on ship + 2 crew in lifeboats
   - Player 2: 8 crew on ship + 2 crew in lifeboats

### Objective
Fill all four lifeboats (get all d6 to "6") before the ship breaks apart (d20 reaches lower than "1"), while saving as many crew members as possible.

### Turn Sequence
Players alternate turns. On your turn:

1. **Roll the d20** - The new value represents the ship's condition
   - If you roll LOWER than the current value, the ship condition worsens to the new value
   - If you roll EQUAL TO OR HIGHER than the current value, the ship condition remains the same

2. **Choose one action**:
   - **Load a Lifeboat**: Roll 1d20
     - If you roll 12 or higher: Add 2 of your crew members to any lifeboat (advance the d6 by 2)
     - If you roll 7-11: Add 1 crew member to a lifeboat (advance any d6 by 1)
     - If you roll 6 or lower: The waves are too rough, no crew can be loaded this turn
   
   - **Rescue Deck Crew**: Roll 1d20
     - If you roll 15 or higher: Rescue 3 additional crew members from below decks
     - If you roll 10-14: Rescue 2 additional crew members from below decks
     - If you roll 6-9: Rescue 1 additional crew member from below decks
     - If you roll 5 or lower: Cannot rescue any crew, and 1 crew member is swept overboard
   
   - **Reinforce Hull**: Roll 1d20
     - If you roll 17 or higher: Improve ship condition by 3 (increase the d20 by 3)
     - If you roll 10-16: Improve ship condition by 2 (increase the d20 by 2)
     - If you roll 5-9: Improve ship condition by 1 (increase the d20 by 1)
     - If you roll 4 or lower: The reinforcement fails, and the ship condition decreases by 1

3. **Storm Phase**: If the current ship value (d20) is:
   - **15-20**: Light storm - No effect
   - **10-14**: Moderate storm - Roll 1d20:
     - 1-5: One random lifeboat is damaged (decrease one d6 by 1, minimum 1)
     - 6-20: No additional damage
   - **5-9**: Severe storm - Roll 1d20:
     - 1-7: One crew member is swept overboard
     - 8-15: One random lifeboat is severely damaged (decrease one d6 by 2, minimum 1)
     - 16-20: No additional damage
   - **1-4**: Hurricane force - Roll 1d20:
     - 1-10: Two crew members are swept overboard
     - 11-15: All lifeboats are damaged (decrease all d6 by 1, minimum 1)
     - 16-20: Ship condition decreases by 1 more point

### Overboard Crew Recovery
When crew fall overboard, add one to the d10 "Overboard" tracker. On your turn, you may use your action to attempt a rescue:
- Roll 1d20:
  - 16+: Rescue 2 overboard crew
  - 10-15: Rescue 1 overboard crew
  - 9 or lower: Cannot rescue any crew this turn

### Game End Conditions
- **Victory**: All four lifeboats reach capacity (all d6 at "6") before the ship breaks apart
- **Defeat**: The ship breaks apart (d20 reaches "1") with fewer than three full lifeboats
- **Game Over**: Ten crew fall overboard
