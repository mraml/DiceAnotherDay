# Solo Puzzle Game: "Cryptic Vault"

## Game Concept
You're a master thief attempting to crack open a cryptic vault with multiple security systems. The coin represents your luck, the d20s represent your skill checks, and the d6s represent the vault's security mechanisms.

## Setup
- Place the coin heads-up in the center of your play area (this is your "luck token")
- The 4d6 form the "security matrix" - roll them and arrange in a 2Ã—2 grid
- Keep the 2d20 handy as your "skill dice"

## Gameplay
The game consists of 3 rounds, each representing a different security system:

### Round 1: Bypass the Alarm (Electronic System)
1. Roll 1d20 - this is your "bypass attempt"
2. You must match or exceed the sum of the two highest dice in your security matrix
3. If successful, flip your luck token to the opposite side
4. If unsuccessful, leave the luck token as is

### Round 2: Pick the Lock (Mechanical System)
1. Roll 1d20 - this is your "lockpick attempt"
2. You must roll a number that falls between the sum of the left column and right column of your security matrix
   - If left column sum = 7 and right column sum = 9, you must roll 8
   - If columns are equal, you must exactly match that number
3. If successful, flip your luck token to the opposite side
4. If unsuccessful, leave the luck token as is

### Round 3: Disarm the Final Trap (Physical System)
1. Re-roll your security matrix (all 4d6)
2. Roll both d20s - these are your "disarm attempts"
3. Each d20 must match or exceed the value of at least one die in the security matrix
4. Success depends on your luck token:
   - If heads-up: you need only ONE d20 to match/exceed a die
   - If tails-up: you need BOTH d20s to match/exceed different dice

## Victory and Defeat
- Complete all three rounds successfully: You've cracked the vault!
- Fail any round: The security system detects you and you must flee empty-handed.

## Advanced Rules
- **Luck Push**: Once per game, you may flip your luck token and re-roll a single die
- **Security Upgrade**: For a harder challenge, add one rule - if you roll any doubles in your security matrix, add +2 to all security dice values

This game blends luck, probability, and decision-making while using exactly the components you specified. The coin creates a "memory" system across rounds that affects difficulty, while the dice interactions create different mathematical puzzles to solve.
