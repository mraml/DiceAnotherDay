# Die for the Colony: A Strategic Dice Game

## Components
- 1 player controls the Ant Colony (uses d20s)
- 1 player controls the Grasshopper Swarm (uses d20s)
- 4 six-sided dice (d6) placed at the center of the playing area, all initially showing "3"

## Objective
- **Ant Colony**: Build your army and turn all center dice to "6"
- **Grasshopper Swarm**: Suppress the ant colony and turn all center dice to "1"

## Setup
1. Place the 4d6 in the center of the play area, all showing "3"
2. Each player starts with 2d20 representing their initial forces
3. **The Grasshopper Swarm player always goes first**
4. Flip a coin to determine who plays as Ants first
5. Players swap teams (Ants/Grasshoppers) after each game

## Turn Structure
On your turn, perform these phases in order:
1. **Recruitment Phase**: Roll 1d20 to add to your forces (see Recruitment rules)
2. **Action Phase**: Assign each of your d20s to perform one action
3. **End Phase**: Check for victory conditions

## Recruitment Phase
- Roll 1d20
- If the result is **16-20**: Add a new d20 to your forces (max 5 d20s total)
- If the result is **1-5**: Your opponent adds a new d20 to their forces (max 5 d20s total)
- If the result is **6-15**: No new forces are added
- **Army Cap**: No player may have more than 5 d20s at once

## Action Phase
Assign each of your d20s to one of these actions:

### 1. ATTACK
- Target one of the center d6
- Roll your d20
- If you roll **11 or higher**:
  - **Ants**: Increase the target d6 by 1 (max 6)
  - **Grasshoppers**: Decrease the target d6 by 1 (min 1)
- Your opponent may block with one of their unassigned d20s

### 2. DEFEND
- When your opponent launches an Attack, you may block with an unassigned d20
- Both players roll their d20s
- If blocker's roll equals or exceeds attacker's roll, the attack fails
- The blocking d20 is then considered used

### 3. MOBILIZE
- Roll your d20 and announce the result
- If you roll **14 or higher**:
  - **Ants**: Choose two adjacent center dice. Decrease one by 1 and increase the other by 2 (within limits of 1-6)
  - **Grasshoppers**: Choose two adjacent center dice. Increase one by 1 and decrease the other by 2 (within limits of 1-6)
- Your opponent may use an unassigned d20 to DISRUPT the mobilization:
  - If the defending player rolls higher than the attacker's initial roll, they block 1 point of the transfer
  - This means the receiving die only changes by 1 instead of 2
  - The disrupting d20 is then considered used

### 4. SABOTAGE
- Target one of your opponent's unused d20s
- Roll your d20
- If you roll **15 or higher**, the targeted d20 cannot be used this turn
- Your opponent may attempt to evade by rolling one of their unassigned d20s
- If they roll **13 or higher**, they successfully evade

### 5. FORTIFY
- Choose one center d6
- Roll your d20
- If you roll **14 or higher**:
  - Place a marker on that d6 (use a coin or token)
  - While marked, opponents need to roll **13+ (instead of 11+)** for Attacks against this d6
  - Remove all markers at the end of your next turn
- This action cannot be blocked

## Strategy Tips
- **Ants**: Focus on protecting high-value d6s (showing 5s) while steadily advancing others
- **Grasshoppers**: Target d6s showing high numbers first to slow the ants' progress
- Fortify creates temporary safe zones for your most critical objectives
- Mobilize offers efficient but less reliable progress
- Sabotage can cripple opponents when timed correctly

## Victory Conditions
- **Ant Colony** wins if all four center d6s show "6"
- **Grasshopper Swarm** wins if all four center d6s show "1"
- If 15 complete rounds pass without a winner, the player who has moved more dice toward their goal wins

## Game Balance Features
- The Grasshopper first-player advantage balances their shorter path to victory
- Army cap prevents runaway snowballing
- Each action has distinct strategic purposes and risk/reward profiles
- Multiple defensive options allow for tactical counterplay
- Team-swapping ensures fair competition over multiple games

Enjoy your battle for the colony!
