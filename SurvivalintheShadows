# WORLD WAR I TRENCH WARFARE: SURVIVAL IN THE SHADOWS

## INTRODUCTION
You are a soldier trapped in the brutal trench warfare of World War I. Your mission: survive the horrors of the Western Front while maintaining your physical health, mental fortitude, and the camaraderie of your fellow soldiers. Every day brings new challenges - artillery barrages, gas attacks, disease, snipers, and the constant pressure to go "over the top" into No Man's Land.

## GAME OVERVIEW
**Players:** 1-4 players  
**Duration:** 1-2 hours per session  
**Components Needed:** 2d20, 4d6, and a coin

## CHARACTER CREATION

### STATISTICS
Each character has four core statistics, tracked using d20s and d6s:

1. **Physical Health (d20)** - Your bodily well-being and injuries
2. **Mental Fortitude (d20)** - Your psychological state and morale
3. **Supplies (4d6)** - Food, water, ammunition, and medical supplies
4. **Camaraderie (Coin)** - Your standing with fellow soldiers (Heads = Good, Tails = Poor)

### STARTING VALUES
- Physical Health: 18 (d20)
- Mental Fortitude: 16 (d20)
- Supplies: Roll 4d6 (each die represents a different type of supply)
  - Food (d6)
  - Water (d6)
  - Ammunition (d6)
  - Medical (d6)
- Camaraderie: Flip coin (Heads = Good Standing, Tails = Poor Standing)

### SPECIALIZATION
Choose one specialization:
- **Rifleman** - +2 to ranged attack rolls, carry extra ammunition
- **Medic** - Can restore 1d6 Physical Health to self or others once per day
- **Engineer** - Better at repairing trenches, creating new structures, +2 to relevant rolls
- **Scout** - Better at reconnaissance missions, +2 to stealth and perception rolls

## GAMEPLAY STRUCTURE

### GAME ROUND
The game is played in rounds representing days at the front lines. Each day consists of:

1. **Dawn Phase** - Roll for daily events and orders
2. **Morning Phase** - Perform maintenance and preparation actions
3. **Afternoon Phase** - Major action phase (combat, missions, etc.)
4. **Evening Phase** - Recovery and social actions
5. **Night Phase** - Rest and potential night events

### ACTIONS
During each phase, characters can perform one major action or multiple minor actions. Actions include:

- Reinforce trench position
- Scavenge for supplies
- Provide medical care
- Reconnaissance mission
- Repair equipment
- Rest and recover
- Write letters home
- Trade with other soldiers
- Stand watch
- Conduct/participate in raids

## CORE MECHANICS

### SKILL CHECKS
When attempting a difficult action, roll d20 and add relevant modifiers. The Difficulty Class (DC) typically ranges from 10 (easy) to 20 (extremely difficult).

### COMBAT
Combat uses the following sequence:
1. Roll d20 for initiative
2. On your turn, declare your action (attack, take cover, etc.)
3. For attacks, roll d20 + modifiers vs. target's Defense Class
4. Roll damage (varies by weapon)
5. Track injuries by reducing Physical Health

**Common Weapons:**
- Rifle: 1d6+2 damage, range advantage
- Pistol: 1d6 damage, quick to use
- Bayonet/Knife: 1d6-1 damage
- Grenade: 2d6 damage to all in area, limited supply

### RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
- Each day, reduce appropriate Supply die by 1
- When a Supply die reaches 0, suffer consequences until resupplied
- Find creative ways to replenish supplies through missions, trading, or scavenging

### CAMARADERIE MECHANICS
The coin represents your standing with fellow soldiers:
- **Heads (Good Standing)**: Others more likely to share supplies, provide cover, assist in missions
- **Tails (Poor Standing)**: May be denied assistance, given dangerous assignments
- Flip the coin after significant social interactions or when called upon for dangerous duty

## HISTORICAL NOTES
This game aims to represent the grim reality of trench warfare while remaining playable. The focus is on survival and the bonds between soldiers rather than glorifying war. Players are encouraged to learn more about the historical context of World War I and the experiences of those who served.

## EXAMPLE OF PLAY

**Dawn Phase:**  
Player rolls a 7 on the Daily Event table: "Rainstorm - trenches begin flooding."  
The Game Master describes how rainfall is making the trenches muddy and miserable.

**Morning Phase:**  
Player decides to "Reinforce trench position" to prevent flooding.  
Rolls d20+Engineering bonus against DC 14.  
Success means the trench section stays relatively dry.

**Afternoon Phase:**  
A patrol is ordered. Player must decide whether to volunteer (could improve Camaraderie but risks health) or try to avoid it (risks poor Camaraderie).  
Player chooses to volunteer and flips the Camaraderie coin to Heads.

**Evening Phase:**  
Player uses medical supplies to treat minor injuries, reducing the Medical Supply die by 1 but recovering 2 points of Physical Health.

**Night Phase:**  
The rain continues. Player must make a DC 12 Physical check to avoid getting sick from the cold and wet conditions.

The next day begins with new challenges...

## ADVANCED CAMPAIGN RULES
For those who wish to play a longer campaign:
- Track promotion through military ranks
- Develop relationships with recurring NPCs
- Experience major historical battles
- Deal with changing military technology and tactics as the war progresses
- Face increasingly difficult psychological challenges as the war drags on

## HISTORICAL ACCURACY NOTE
While this game attempts to convey some of the hardships of trench warfare, it cannot fully represent the true horrors experienced by soldiers in World War I. It is designed as a respectful way to explore this historical period through gameplay, balancing historical elements with engaging mechanics.
