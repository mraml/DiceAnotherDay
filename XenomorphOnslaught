## Xenomorph Onslaught

**Theme:** Extraterrestrial invaders have landed, and you (and your allies, in coop mode) are trying to survive and push back against the alien threat.

**Components:**

* 4 six-sided dice (d6)
* 1 coin per player (for tracking "Abducted" status)

**Setup:**

* Each player starts with their coin showing the "Safe" side (e.g., Heads).
* Decide on a target number of "Resistance Points" to achieve to win the game (e.g., 15 for solo, 20 for 2 players, etc.). These points represent successfully repelling alien incursions.

**Gameplay:**

Each round consists of the following phases:

1.  **Alien Onslaught:** Roll all 4d6. The results of these dice represent the strength and type of the alien attacks this round.

2.  **Player Actions:** Each non-abducted player takes their turn. On their turn, a player can choose **one** of the following actions:

    * **Fortify Defenses:** Choose two of the rolled dice. The sum of these two dice is added to the group's Resistance Points.
    * **Scout for Weaknesses:** Choose one of the rolled dice. If the result is a 5 or 6, the player gains a "Tactical Advantage." This advantage can be used later to re-roll one die during the Alien Onslaught phase. A player can hold a maximum of two Tactical Advantages.
    * **Attempt Rescue (Co-op Only):** If another player is Abducted, a non-abducted player can attempt a rescue. Roll one die. If the result is a 4 or higher, the abducted player is freed and flips their coin to the "Safe" side. This action ends the current player's turn.

3.  **Abduction Check:** After all non-abducted players have taken their actions, check the results of the remaining rolled dice from the Alien Onslaught phase.

    * **Abduction Trigger:** If any of the remaining dice show a result of 1 or 2, one non-abducted player becomes "Abducted." If multiple 1s or 2s are rolled, multiple non-abducted players are abducted (if available). The abducted player flips their coin to the "Abducted" side (e.g., Tails).
    * **Solo Mode Abduction:** In solo mode, if an abduction occurs, the player flips their coin to "Abducted." They cannot take actions on their next turn.

4.  **Abducted Player Phase:** If a player is Abducted, they cannot take normal actions. On their turn, they must attempt to free themselves:

    * **Solo Escape Attempt:** The abducted player rolls one die. If the result is a 5 or 6, they manage to escape and flip their coin back to the "Safe" side.
    * **Co-op Escape:** An abducted player can only be freed by another player's "Attempt Rescue" action (see Player Actions).

5.  **End of Round:** Discard the rolled dice. A new round begins with the Alien Onslaught phase.

**Winning the Game:**

* **Solo:** The player wins if they accumulate the target number of Resistance Points before becoming permanently unable to act (e.g., being abducted for three consecutive rounds without escaping).
* **Co-op:** The players win if they collectively accumulate the target number of Resistance Points before all players are simultaneously abducted and unable to escape.

**Losing the Game:**

* **Solo:** The player loses if they are abducted for three consecutive rounds without successfully escaping.
* **Co-op:** The players lose if all players are simultaneously abducted and unable to escape on their turn.

**Variations and Advanced Rules:**

* **Special Alien Dice:** Introduce different colored dice with unique effects on their faces (e.g., a green die that always triggers an abduction on a 1, a red die that adds more Resistance Points on higher rolls).
* **Technology Cards:** Allow players to spend Resistance Points to acquire cards that grant special abilities (e.g., re-roll a die, automatically succeed on one rescue attempt, gain a permanent bonus to defense).
* **Alien Artifacts:** Introduce negative consequences for failing to deal with certain die results (e.g., rolling three 3s might reduce your Resistance Points).
* **Hero Abilities (Co-op):** Give each player a unique starting ability that aids the group.
