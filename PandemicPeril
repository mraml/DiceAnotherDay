# Pandemic Peril: A Solo d20 Game

**Objective:** Survive the escalating pandemic and develop a cure before humanity is overwhelmed.

**Setup:**

1.  **The Threat:** Choose a disease severity level (this affects the starting Infection Rate):
    * **Mild:** Start at Infection Rate 1.
    * **Moderate:** Start at Infection Rate 2.
    * **Severe:** Start at Infection Rate 3.
2.  **Your Role:** You are a lone scientist working against the clock.
3.  **Hope Track:** Start with a Hope Level of 6. This represents global morale and resources.
4.  **Cure Track:** Start at 0. You need to reach a Cure Level of 3 to win.

**Gameplay - Each Round:**

1.  **Action Phase (Roll 1d20):** Your roll determines your actions and their success:
    * **1-5: Setback!** The pandemic worsens. Increase the Infection Rate by 1. Decrease your Hope Level by 1.
    * **6-10: Research:** You make some progress. Increase your Cure Level by 1.
    * **11-15: Containment:** You manage to slow the spread in a region. Decrease the Infection Rate by 1 (to a minimum of 0).
    * **16-20: Breakthrough!** You make significant progress on the cure AND manage to contain the spread. Increase your Cure Level by 1. Decrease the Infection Rate by 1 (to a minimum of 0).

2.  **Infection Phase:** Roll 1d20. The outcome depends on the current Infection Rate:
    * **Infection Rate 1:**
        * 1-10: No significant spread.
        * 11-20: Minor outbreak. Decrease Hope Level by 1.
    * **Infection Rate 2:**
        * 1-5: No significant spread.
        * 6-15: Moderate outbreak. Decrease Hope Level by 2.
        * 16-20: Major outbreak. Decrease Hope Level by 3.
    * **Infection Rate 3+:**
        * 1-3: No significant spread.
        * 4-10: Moderate outbreak. Decrease Hope Level by 2.
        * 11-20: Catastrophic outbreak. Decrease Hope Level by 4.

**Winning and Losing:**

* **You Win:** If your Cure Level reaches 3.
* **You Lose:** If your Hope Level reaches 0.

**Optional Rules/Variations:**

* **Event Rolls:** At the start of each round, roll a separate d6. On a 1 or 2, consult an "Event Table" (you can create this with positive and negative events like "New research funding increases Hope by 1" or "Supply chain disruption decreases Hope by 2").
* **Specialist Abilities:** Before starting, choose a specialization (e.g., Virologist, Epidemiologist, Logistical Expert). This could grant a bonus on certain Action Phase rolls (e.g., Virologist gets +2 on Research rolls).
* **Increasing Difficulty:** Once you win, try again with a higher starting Infection Rate or lower starting Hope Level.
* **Narrative Prompts:** Use the die rolls to guide a short narrative of your struggle. For example, a "Setback!" roll could represent a new mutation, while a "Breakthrough!" could be a promising new lead in your research.
