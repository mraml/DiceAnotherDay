# Dead Zone: A d20 Zombie Apocalypse Solo Adventure

## Introduction
The world as we knew it ended three years ago when the outbreak began. Cities fell, governments collapsed, and the dead rose 
to feast on the living. You're a lone survivor trying to reach the rumored safe haven of New Eden, a fortified settlement 20 
miles away through infected territory. Armed with your wits and whatever you can scavenge, you must navigate through 20 zones 
of zombie-infested wasteland. All you need is a single d20 and your memory to track your desperate journey.

## Core Concept
You are a survivor making your way through 20 miles of zombie-infested wasteland to reach the sanctuary of New Eden. Your goal 
is to reach Zone 20 and gain entry to the safe haven by defeating the Horde Leader guarding the approach. Everything is tracked 
mentally, with your d20 determining all outcomes.

## Survivor Stats
Your survivor has three stats that you'll track mentally:
- **Health**: Start with 20 Health
- **Combat Skill**: Start with 1 (your attack strength)
- **Armor**: Start with 0 (your defense)

## Zombie Stats
Enemies have two stats you'll need to track:
- **Health**: Current threat level × 2
- **Attack Strength**: Current threat level ÷ 3 (rounded up)

### Horde Leader Tip
The Horde Leader has 40 health. A coin can be used in combination with a d20 to track its health. Start with a d20
showing 20 and the coin on heads. Once the Horde leader loses 20 health, set the d20 back to showing 20 and flip 
the coin to tails.

### Optimal Setup
- While you can play this game with 1d20, it's easier to track your progress with a tracker app, paper, or 7 dice, and a coin.

## Game Flow
Your journey consists of 20 zones, numbered 1 through 20. You begin in Zone 1, and your goal is to reach and survive Zone 20.

For each zone:
1. Roll the d20 to determine what you encounter
2. Resolve the encounter
3. If you survive, proceed to the next zone

## Zone Encounters (d20 roll)
- **1-10**: Zombie encounter
- **11-14**: Supply cache
- **15-17**: Shelter (restore health)
- **18-19**: Hazard
- **20**: Clear path (safe passage)

## Zombie Encounters
When you encounter zombies:
1. The zombie threat level equals the current zone number
2. The zombie horde's health equals its threat level × 2
3. The zombie attack strength equals its threat level ÷ 3 (rounded up)
4. Combat alternates between your attacks and the zombies' attacks

### On your turn:
1. Roll the d20
2. If you roll higher than (zombie threat level), your attack hits
3. On a hit, you deal damage equal to your Combat Skill

### On the zombies' turn:
1. Roll the d20
2. If the zombies roll higher than (1 + your Armor), their attack connects
3. On a hit, you lose Health equal to the zombies' attack strength

Combat continues until either you or the zombies reach 0 health. If you defeat the zombies, you gain +1 Combat Skill from the 
experience.

## Supply Caches
When you find a supply cache:
1. Roll the d20 to determine what you scavenge
   - **1-7**: Gain +1 Combat Skill (better weapon)
   - **8-14**: Gain +1 Armor (protective gear)
   - **15-19**: First aid kit (restore 5 Health immediately)
   - **20**: Rare equipment (roll again)
      - **1-5**: Serrated Blade (+1 Health when you hit a zombie)
      - **6-10**: Riot Gear (+2 Armor)
      - **11-15**: Military-grade Weapon (+2 Combat Skill)
      - **16-20**: Survivor's Pack (heal to full)

## Shelters
When you find a secure shelter:
1. Roll the d20
2. Restore that many Health points (up to your maximum)

## Hazards
When you encounter a hazard:
1. Roll the d20
2. If you roll higher than (1 + zone number), you avoid the hazard
3. If you fail to avoid the hazard, take damage equal to the zone number

## Zone 20: Horde Leader
The final zone contains a massive horde led by a mutated leader:
- Leader Health: 40
- Leader Attack: 5
- To hit the Leader, you must roll 15 or higher
- The Leader hits you on a roll of 10 or higher

## Special Rules

### Critical Hit
If you or a Zombie rolls a natural 20 on an attack, execute a critical hit and deal double damage.

### Last Stand
If your Health reaches 0, you're not dead yet! Roll the d20:
- If you roll 10 or higher, your survival instinct kicks in and you recover with 1 Health
- If you roll below 10, you become one of the infected

You can only use Last Stand once per journey.

### Rest Period
Once per game, before entering a zone, you can choose to rest in a secure location. Roll the d20 and recover that many Health.

## Mental Tracking Tips
Since this game requires you to remember several values:
- Use the position of your d20 to mark your current zone (set it to the zone number)
- Recite your stats out loud after each encounter
- Consider using the "20 minus X" method to track Health (e.g., if you have 15 Health, remember "5 damage taken")

## Example Turn
You're in Zone 3 with 18 Health, 2 Combat Skill, and 1 Armor.

1. Roll to determine encounter: You roll a 7 → Zombie encounter
2. The zombies are threat level 3, with 6 Health and 1 Attack strength
3. Your turn: You roll a 15, which is higher than 13 (10 + zombie threat level), so your attack hits! You deal 2 damage.
4. Zombies have 4 Health remaining
5. Zombies' turn: You roll an 8, which is less than 11 (10 + your Armor), so they miss
6. Your turn: You roll a 17, hitting again for 2 damage
7. Zombies have 2 Health remaining
8. Zombies' turn: You roll a 12, so they hit you for 1 damage
9. Your Health is now 17
10. Your turn: You roll an 18, hitting for 2 damage
11. The zombies are defeated! You gain +1 Combat Skill (now at 3)
12. You proceed to Zone 4

## Victory and Defeat
- You win if you defeat the Horde Leader in Zone 20
- You lose if your Health reaches 0 and you fail your Last Stand roll

## Difficulty Variants
- **Prepared Survivor Mode**: Start with Combat Skill 2, Armor 1
- **Nightmare Mode**: Zombie threat levels are zone number + 2
- **True Death Mode**: No Last Stand ability

## Apocalyptic Flavor Text
When zombies attack you: "The moaning horde lurches forward, decayed hands grasping and teeth gnashing for your flesh."

When you defeat zombies: "The last of the walking dead collapses with a sickening thud, dark fluid pooling beneath its 
finally-still corpse."

When finding a supply cache: "Beneath the rubble, someone's last desperate stockpile remains untouched—their loss, your gain."

When triggering a hazard: "In this broken world, sometimes the living dead aren't the most dangerous threat."

At Zone 20: "Beyond the sea of rotting corpses stands a towering figure—once human, now something else entirely. Its eyes, 
unlike the vacant stares of its minions, track you with terrifying intelligence."

Good luck, survivor. The dead are waiting.
