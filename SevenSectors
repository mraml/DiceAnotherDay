# Calculator Roguelike: The Station of Seven Sectors

A sci-fi themed roguelike game that can be played with just a calculator, a coin, and a d20!

## Game Overview

In **Calculator Roguelike: The Station of Seven Sectors**, you're a lone operative infiltrating an abandoned space station. Each compartment is represented by a number on your calculator. Your mission is to descend through all 9 sectors, defeat the rogue AI core, and escape with the quantum encryption key before the station self-destructs.

## Required Equipment
- A basic calculator (with at least 0-9 digits, +, -, ×, ÷, and = functions)
- A coin (heads/tails)
- A d20 (20-sided die)

## Character Creation

1. Roll your stats by pressing random digits on your calculator 3 times: 
   - First number = your HP (health points) × 5
   - Second number = your ATK (attack power)
   - Third number = your DEF (defense)

2. You start with 0 credits and 1 medkit (restores 10 HP).

## Game Board

The calculator display represents your current compartment. At the start, clear your calculator (press C or AC).

## Gameplay

### Basic Actions

On each turn, you may take ONE of these actions:
- **Move** to an adjacent compartment (explained below)
- **Attack** a hostile in your current compartment
- **Scan** for resources
- **Use** a medkit (restore 10 HP)
- **Rest** at a power node (restore 2 HP)

### Moving Through the Station

1. To move, add, subtract, multiply, or divide your current compartment number by 1-9:
   - '+1' might move you forward
   - '-1' might move you backward
   - '×2' might move you right
   - '÷2' might move you left

2. If the result has more digits than your current sector number, you've hit a sealed bulkhead. Your turn ends.

3. Hostile Encounters: After moving, flip the coin:
   - **Heads**: No hostile
   - **Tails**: Hostile detected! Roll d20:
     - 1-10: Security Drone (HP: current compartment ones digit, ATK: 2)
     - 11-15: Malfunctioning Robot (HP: current compartment ones digit + 3, ATK: 3)
     - 16-19: Combat Mech (HP: current compartment ones digit + 5, ATK: 4)
     - 20: Security Lieutenant (HP: current compartment ones digit + 10, ATK: 5)

### Combat

1. **Attack**: Roll d20 + your ATK vs. hostile's HP
   - If roll + ATK > hostile HP: You win! Gain credits equal to hostile's HP
   - If roll + ATK ≤ hostile HP: The hostile survives and counterattacks

2. **Hostile Attack**: Hostile ATK - your DEF = damage you take
   - Minimum damage is always 1

### Scanning

1. When you scan, roll d20:
   - 1-5: Nothing found
   - 6-15: Find credits (current compartment digit × 2)
   - 16-19: Find a medkit (restores 10 HP)
   - 20: Find equipment! Roll d20 again:
     - 1-10: Weapon upgrade (+1 ATK)
     - 11-20: Shield upgrade (+1 DEF)

### Accessing New Sectors

To descend to the next sector:
1. Find the compartment numbered '0' on your current sector
2. You must have credits equal to or greater than (current sector × 5)
3. Pay the credits to override security and move to the next sector
4. Your compartment number becomes your current sector number

### Special Compartments

- **Compartment 7**: Regeneration Pod (restore 5 HP)
- **Compartment 3**: Supply Terminal (can buy 1 medkit for 10 credits)
- **Compartment 8**: Radiation Leak (roll d20 - lose HP equal to roll unless you have DEF greater than the roll)
- **Compartment 9**: Upgrade Station (flip coin - heads: +1 ATK, tails: +1 DEF)

### The Final Confrontation

On sector 9, in compartment 0, you'll face the Rogue AI Core:
- HP: 30
- ATK: 7

If you defeat it, you win the game!

## Victory & Defeat

- **Victory**: Defeat the Rogue AI Core and escape with the quantum encryption key
- **Defeat**: If your HP reaches 0, you perish in the station

## Game Log

- Current compartment number (displayed)

## Example Turn

1. You're in compartment 5 on sector 1.
2. You decide to move by adding 2: 5 + 2 = 7
3. You're now in compartment 7 (regeneration pod): gain 5 HP
4. Flip coin for hostile encounter: Tails - hostile detected!
5. Roll d20: 13 - Malfunctioning Robot appears with HP 7+3=10, ATK 3
6. You attack: roll d20 (15) + your ATK (4) = 19 vs hostile HP 10
7. You defeat the hostile and gain 10 credits

Good luck on your mission, operative! The fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.
